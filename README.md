# DevOps Docker Compose Project

## Foreword

This is a current work-in-progress project, where I am further
improving the full-stack website I made in my advanced web development
course. To make this more DevOps oriented, I've containerized the website
in Docker and added some CI with a custom GitHub Actions workflow.  


## Summary
This is a finance tracker using HTML5, CSS3, and JS for the 
frontend, PHP + MySQL database for the backend, and GitHub Actions for CI.

## Prerequisites
1. Have Docker installed and running.
